		<p><b>Definition:</b><br>Web usability refers to the way a person(user) easily accesses a website i.e. making a website more presentable with  accurate distribution of content throughout so the user can get what they want without trying so hard.</p> 
		<p  class="col">
		 The content of usability has been generated by going through the lessons of author 'Steve Krug's' novel 'Don't me think' which discusses what web usability is and things to do in order to implement usability within your website. There are certain tips which will help you make your website more usable and one of them is <b>never confuse the user</b> i.e. clearly describe how the user will benefit as soon as they visit your website, so that it keeps them interested, this is one of the major points that a designer should keep in mind and Now,i will switch to bullet points so that reading a long paragraph does not frustrate you, which is one of the tip to make a website usable.
		 <ul>
		 	<li>While designing, consider things with the user's perspective.</li>
		 	<li>English is a globally accepted language and is written from left to right, a person who reads english always starts from the left, so <b>make the most important things appear on the left of the webpage.</b></li>
		 	<li>
		 		Keep in mind that the user has a goal in mind when they visit a web page, make them feel they are close to the important information by making your website <b>navigable.</b>
		 	</li>
		 	<li> Majority of the users <b>scan</b> through the website rather than reading every instruction, so by categorising your website things can be found easily.</li><br><br>
		 	
		 </ul>
